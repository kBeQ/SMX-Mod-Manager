## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Organize Your Mods:** Set up "Libraries" (your main mod folders) and organize mods by type (`Tracks`, `Suits`, `Sounds`) and custom categories.
*   **One-Click Install & Update:** Select one or more mods and install or update them on the emulator with a single click. The manager automatically handles folder creation and file transfers.
*   **Rich Mod Previews:** The UI intelligently validates your mod folders, showing you:
    *   ‚úÖ If required track (`.smxlevel`) or sound (`.wav`) files are present.
    *   ‚úÖ Previews for `icon.jpg`, `gear_suit.png`, and `gear_suit_normal.png` for suit mods.
*   **On-Device Management:** Scan the emulator to find "unmanaged" mods (those you copied manually) and easily delete them to clean up your installation.
*   **Built-in ADB Console:** A console for power users to send custom ADB commands directly to the emulator.
*   **Customizable Interface:** Choose from several themes to personalize your experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To use this tool, you **MUST** have the **Developer Emulator** version of Google Play Games on PC installed. The standard public version is locked down and will not allow the Mod Manager to access the necessary game files.

*   **Download Link:** [Google Play Games for PC (Developer Emulator)](https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/emulator)

**The standard public version of Google Play Games will not work!**

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/kBeQ/SMX Mod Manager/releases) of this repository.
2.  Download the latest `SMX_Mod_Manager_Build.zip` file.
3.  Unzip the folder to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., your Desktop or `C:\Program Files`).
4.  Run `smx_mod_manager.exe` from inside the unzipped folder.

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. First-Time Setup
*   Open the Mod Manager and go to the **Settings** tab.
*   Under "Local Mod Library," click **"Add Folder..."**.
*   Select the main folder on your PC where you store all your mods (e.g., a folder called "My SMX Mods").
*   You will be prompted to select the **type** of mods this library contains (Tracks, Sounds, or Suits).

### 2. Organizing Your Local Mods
For the manager to find your mods, you need a simple folder structure. Inside the main Library folder you just added:

*   Create subfolders for each type: `Tracks`, `Sounds`, and `Suits`.
*   To create categories within a type, make a folder with a `c_` prefix (e.g., `c_Supermoto`).
*   Place each individual mod in its own folder.

**Example Structure:**
```
My SMX Mods/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tracks/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ c_Supermoto/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ My Awesome Track/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Track.smxlevel
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.jpg
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Uncategorized Track/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Track.smxlevel
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.jpg
```

### 3. Installing Mods
1.  Launch the Google Play Games Developer Emulator and start SMX.
2.  In the **Mod Manager** tab, wait for the status indicator to turn green and say "Connected".
3.  Select the mod(s) you want to install. You can **Ctrl+Click** to select multiple.
4.  Click the **"Install/Update Selected"** button on the left.
5.  The log output at the bottom will show the progress!
